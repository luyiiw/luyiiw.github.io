## Project Description
"Rising Waters: Coastal Cities at Risk" is a research-driven exploration of how climate change-induced sea level rise and storm surges are impacting major coastal cities. Originally published as an ArcGIS StoryMap, this project demonstrates the increasing vulnerabilities of urban areas along coastlines and highlights the urgent need for adaptive strategies.

### Project Details
**Project Type**: Individual

**Contributers**: Lu Yii Wong

**Skills**: ArcGIS, StoryMapping, Raster Analysis, Communication

## Introduction
With nearly 40% of the world’s population residing within 100 kilometers of a coastline, rising sea levels pose significant risks to infrastructure, economies, and communities. Through geospatial analysis and case studies, this project investigates the unique challenges faced by three coastal cities, Miami, Jakarta, and Venice, each struggling with varying degrees of flooding, land subsidence, and storm surge risks.
By incorporating data-driven analysis, flood modeling, and socio-economic assessments, the project aims to communicate complex environmental issues in an accessible way. It also underscores the importance of urban planning, policy intervention, and resilience strategies in mitigating future risks.

## Key Themes & Findings

- **Sea Level Rise & Climate Change**: Thermal expansion of seawater and glacial melt are accelerating sea level rise, threatening coastal cities worldwide.
- **Storm Surges & Extreme Weather**: Rising seas amplify storm surges, increasing the impact of hurricanes, typhoons, and seasonal flooding.
- **City-Specific Challenges**:
  - ***Miami, USA***: Highly susceptible to storm surges, tidal flooding, and socio-economic disparities in resilience efforts.
  - ***Jakarta, Indonesia***: One of the fastest-sinking cities globally, with land subsidence and poor water management exacerbating flood risks.
  - ***Venice, Italy***: Endangered by frequent “acqua alta” events, land subsidence, and the challenges of preserving historical infrastructure.

##  Significance & Impact
This project highlights the necessity of proactive resilience planning, equitable adaptation strategies, and long-term policy solutions. As sea levels continue to rise, understanding the interplay between environmental, socio-economic, and infrastructural factors is crucial in shaping sustainable urban futures.
