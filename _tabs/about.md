### Hi, I’m Lu Yii!  

I’m a city-loving, map-making, data-crunching urban planner with a passion for turning spatial analytics into real-world impact. Whether it’s modeling storm surges in coastal cities, mapping health equity in Philadelphia, or optimizing bike share systems in Manhattan, I love uncovering the hidden patterns that shape our built environment.  

My journey into urban planning started with a deep curiosity about cities—first from growing up in Singapore, then from experiencing the dynamic cityscapes of China. That curiosity led me to study Sustainable Urban Environments at New York University. While living in New York City, I fell in love with data analytics. I then moved on to explore the combination of my interests at the University of Pennsylvania where I am  studying Urban Spatial Analytics and City and Regional Planning. Through my coursework, I've tackled everything from addressing holistic planning for flood resilience in small Vermont towns to food security in New York.

I thrive at the intersection of geospatial technology, design, and data-driven decision-making, using tools like ArcGIS, Python, and R to create solutions for more equitable and resilient communities. When I’m not working on maps or models, you’ll probably find me exploring new languages (300+ days into my Duolingo Japanese streak!), searching for new food spots, or geeking out over public transit systems.  

Let’s connect and make cities better through awesome data communication!
