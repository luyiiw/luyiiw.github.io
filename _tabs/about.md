### Hi, I’m Lu Yii!  

I’m an urban planner and spatial data analyst specializing in land use and environmental resilience! I’m currently pursuing a dual degree in City Planning and Urban Spatial Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania, where I spend a lot of time thinking about how we can make communities more equitable, resilient, and livable.

My work often lives at the intersection of data, design, and place, from mapping health disparities in Philly to modeling storm surges and urban heat islands. I’m constantly experimenting with new tools like Python, R, and ArcGIS to uncover patterns and tell stories to communicate how cities grow and adapt to our changing climate.

Outside of school and work, I’m interested in learning languages. I am learning Japanese and have a Duolingo Japanese streak of over 400 days (and counting). I’m also a frantic cat lover. My two furballs, Jesse and Lola, are back home in Singapore with my parents, and I miss them constantly.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you'd like to chat about it!
