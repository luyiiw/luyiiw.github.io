### Hi, I’m Lu Yii Wong!  

I’m a city-loving, map-making, data-crunching urban planner with a passion for turning spatial analytics into real-world impact. Whether it’s modeling storm surges in coastal cities, mapping health equity in Philadelphia, or optimizing bike share systems in Manhattan, I love uncovering the hidden patterns that shape our built environment.  

My journey into urban planning started with a deep curiosity about cities—first from growing up in Singapore, then from experiencing the dynamic cityscapes of China. That curiosity led me to study City and Regional Planning and Urban Spatial Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania, where I’ve tackled everything from flood resilience in small Vermont towns to food security in New York.  

I thrive at the intersection of geospatial technology, design, and data-driven decision-making, using tools like ArcGIS, Python, and R to create solutions for more equitable and resilient communities. When I’m not working on maps or models, you’ll probably find me exploring new languages (270+ days into my Duolingo Japanese streak!), searching for the best dumplings in town, or geeking out over public transit systems.  

Let’s connect and make cities smarter, greener, and more inclusive! 🚀🌍
